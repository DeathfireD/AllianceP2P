#summary Developers Corner - Preview Build.
#labels Phase-Deploy
*v1.2.0pre build (1281)*

*This build is mainly to help people translate Alliance*, however it should still be stable enough to use on a daily basis.

This build has only been tested on Windows but should still function under Linux and Mac...maybe.

This build doesn't have the final version of DB. The next few releases after v1.2.0pre build (1281) may require re-hashing because we plan to better handling duplicates.

*You can migrating settings.xml (only) from older versions but it requires the following:*

    * If present rename lansupport variable to lanmode (Or better delete and re-check lan mode in option window) not doing this = alliance will not start


The next builds should be downloadable and installed through the new auto-updater. You'll see a popup when there's a new version available. All you have to do is click a few buttons and you're done :).

*Every issue you find should be reported to the issues tracker. Please add version and build number.*
