Alliance takes the best from BitTorrent, Direct Connect and Waste and creates a decentralized and secure p2p network. It is a private and secure environment to share files and communicate with people you know. Alliance works on Windows, Linux and Mac.

This site is for the Beta branch and latest releases.

For older versions of Alliance you can still get them on the SourceForge site visit: http://sourceforge.net/projects/alliancep2p/
